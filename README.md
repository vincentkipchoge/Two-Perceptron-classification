# Two-Perceptron-classification
Task 1:

This is an implementation using two perceptrons to classify/recognizing a blocks image (such as one image shown below) to make a decision if an image is BRIGHT or DARK. There are 16 different samples for the inputs.

Parameter:


– If it contains 2, 3 or 4 white pixels, it is “bright”

– If it contains 0 or 1 white pixels, it is “dark”





Task 2:

In addition I Designed a Single-Layers Perceptron for the classification of spam emails and the output of the program will result in a confusion matrix.
